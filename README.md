# Risk Encryption

## Installing

Run [cargo build --release] and a binary will be created that can only be executed when in the risk-encryption directory

## Use

Risk encryption is a peice of malware that encrypts the main drive of a users device. Once the Malware has been run the drive will be encrypted and the program will delete itself leaving no trace of itself.

This is not ransomware it is purely just distructive, the program when run will look like a regular TUI disk encryption program and will delete itslelf after being run.

Also I realised after starting the project that the same thing has been done on Mr Robot and was probably subconsiously inspired by it.
